Problem Statement:
Performing phoneme classification on the TIMIT dataset by training and testing gmm models for each phoneme.

Procedure followed :
i) Preprocessing
a) Downloaded and extracted the timit dataset
b) Converted the wav files from NIST “SPHERE” file format to WAVE PCM format using “sphn_to_wav.py” file
c) Training and testing are in 2 separate ipynb files, 'train.ipynb' and 'test.ipynb' respectively.

ii) Training
a) Used “import_timit.py” file to generate mfcc (13 dim), mfcc + delta (26 dim), mfcc + delta + delta (39 dim) features. They are saved in “features/” as train1.hdf, train2.hdf and train3.hdf respectively.
b) train.ipynb reads the mfcc features, extracts the feature and label array, and fits a gmm for each phoneme. 
c) The gmms are then saved onto the system using the pickle library 

iii) Testing
a) Similar to the training process, mfcc features are generated, for the test directory of TIMIT
b) Feature and label array are extracted. This label array acts as the ground truth for the test dataset.
c) The trained gmms are loaded from disk. 
d) MAP rule is applied, to classify each feature vector in the sequence, for a given test file (40-way classification), and the predicted labels are stored in an array
e) Frame-level accuracy and Phoneme error rate are calculated using ground truth array and predicted labels array

To run :
i) Training
a) To perform training, first extract mfcc features (including 0, 1 and 2 delta features) for each train and test, using the foll. command:
	Generic : 'python import_timit.py --timit <path of TIMIT directory> --n_delta <No of delta features to be added>'
	Sample  : 'python import_timit.py --timit TIMIT/ --n_delta 1'
b) Then check out the steps in train.ipynb

ii) Testing
Check out the steps in test.ipynb

Folders in repo:
i)features - Contain mfcc features, along with delta features(0,1,2), of training set and testing set of TIMIT dataset. Saved as train1.hdf, train2.hdf, train3.hdf and a similar naming scheme for test set too.
ii)models - Contains pickled trained models for all phonemes
iii)TIMIT - contains files of the TIMIT dataset
iv)results - contains 2 files. The observations.txt file contains the results as observed. The report.odt/pdf contains the discussion surrounding the observations as part of the entire report.

Other files in repo:
-> per.py - The per.py file is imported as an external file in test.ipynb file, for using it's phoneme error rate functionality.
-> team_members.txr
-> requirements.txt
-> import_timit.py
-> train_wavs
-> test_wavs 
-> train.ipynb
